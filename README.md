## 🧠 Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Normalizing/standardizing features
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution of key features
   - Correlation analysis
   - Visualization of cancer prevalence
3. **Model Building**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   - Gradient Boosting
4. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Accuracy
   - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   - ROC Curve & AUC Score
5. **Insights**
   - Most significant risk factors
   - Practical implications for healthcare
